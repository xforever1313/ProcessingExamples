# Random Card Flip

This example is meant to be used for Scouts taking the [Scouting America](https://www.scouting.org/) [Game Design](https://www.scouting.org/merit-badges/game-design/) to help them choose which five game design terms to talk about in requirement #2.

This is meant to be a fun way to show scouts how even a simple choice can be gamified.

## Instructions

When starting, cards are numbered between 1-17.  Clicking on one will reveal the underlying term a scout should define.  The "Reset" button will flip the cards back over, and scramble them.
