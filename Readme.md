# Processing Examples

These are examples for using [Processing](https://processing.org/), a software sketchbook that can be used for making proof-of-concept simulations and games.

## Installing Processing

Visit the [Download](https://processing.org/download) page and download Processing.  It should be a .zip file.  Unzip it anywhere that is convenient.

## Running programs

Each folder is a different example.  Pick the one that interests you.  On Windows, you should be able to double-click on any .pde file for the Processing editor to open up.  Once its open, click the Play button to compile and run the application.
